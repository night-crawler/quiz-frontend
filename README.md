# quiz-frontend

This is a frontend for [quiz](https://github.com/night-crawler/quiz) repository backend. It's written completely in Kotlin.

Also, it has quite a few useful Kotlin/JS binding for various libraries:
  - codemirror
  - connected-react-router
  - date-fns
  - history
  - markdown-it
  - lab-autocomplete
  - prismjs
  - react-codemirror2
  - react-dom-test-utils
  - react-helmet
  - react-syntax-highlighter
  - react-use
  - react-virtualized-auto-sizer
  - react-window
  - react-window-infinite-loader
  - redux-form
  
Not all of them are well-tested though.
